## About the Video Course
Most Important: Friends, please be sure to look through the course curriculum with meticulous care before buying to be sure this course will work for you. Thank you. This course has been updated to bring it up to date with SQL Server 2017. The new course features audio done with a studio microphone. If you are at the intermediate or advanced level in SQL, do not join this course. The explanations can be very detailed at times, so be sure you enjoy that. Some of the videos cover programming, and some cover using a variety of resources without programming. Various topics are discussed through the videos. For example, there is not just one video on indexes because indexes are too big a topic. The author discuss indexes through the videos where they play a role. The same applies to other concepts.
